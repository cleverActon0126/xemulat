Geb officially disowned tug. Now @Geb’s Son (real) replacing the role of elder and first brother.
tug went down to an alleyway that night. He cried until 01:12. Some people noticed him and tried to help. It did not work.

01:21 - 12/10/22
Tug founds an old rope in the dumpster next to him. Without a second thought, he climbs on top of the apartment using stairs. Ties the rope on his neck and on the floor of the roof. He sits down for 7 minutes.

01:33 - 12/10/22
Streets completely silent and very few people are out there. Soon, this will be the last night a teenager will ever see. As the moon completely rises, Tug looks down. Thinking about the times @Geb called him a disappointment. In the blink of an eye, he jumps down.
The rope forcing his neck to break is not enough to take away his life. With his body pushing against the rope, it cuts off. Falling down to dirty and cold asphalt from 39 meters. The seconds feeling like hours, days, months... While his eyes flashing right before his eyes, he thinks for the last time about his dad. The person who raised him. Taught him. His best friend, his dad, his closest ally, his only matter in this world  had just abandoned him.

Black. No noise whatsoever. Ambulance is being called by the people that were there. It arrives in 11 minutes.

01:53 - 12/10/22
Tug is quickly being carried on the amblance. The medics take immediate action of first aid. He losts a significant amount of blood caused by the fall. His hearts stops twice until they arrive on the nearest hospital.

Geb was informed.

05:23 - 12/10/22
As the sun rises, a noise from hospital room takes place. A noise of a heart stopping...
The teenager who was just beginning his life was no longer with us.
Geb being even more careful about @Geb’s Son (real) after his son took his own life away. Geb was not sad at all. Not at all..
